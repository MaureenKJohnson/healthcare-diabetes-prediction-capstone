# Healthcare Diabetes Prediction Capstone

## Overview
This project evaluates patient-level predictors of diabetes using a dataset derived from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The objective was to assess data quality, feature behavior, and model performance in a healthcare analytics context.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- Identification and treatment of missing and implausible values  
- Regression-based and random imputation  
- Feature transformation and scaling  
- Logistic regression and ensemble classification models  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC  

## Tools
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Visualization
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to communicate key healthcare-related patterns and model insights.

## Data Access
The dataset used in this analysis is derived from NIDDK sources. To respect data use considerations, the dataset is not redistributed here. All preprocessing steps, modeling code, and analytic outputs are fully documented in the accompanying report.

## Intended Use
This project is provided for portfolio and demonstration purposes.
